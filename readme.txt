A free, easy to use customisable prize draw/competition/contest engine for Wordpress. View entrees and auto-pick a winner.

== Description ==

No Frills Prize Draw is a simple customisable prize draw/competition/contest engine. This is the Lite version of No Frills Prize Draw PRO which offers many more features. 
You can create a variety of different competition types, including:
- Single line entry
- Multiple choice entry
- Prize draws with correct answers, open answers or no answer
- Pro version includes additional custom fields

Customise your prize draw to allow members OR none-members. Include your own terms and conditions.

View all the entries, you can also export the data as a csv file.

No Frills Prize Draw will automatically pick a winner when requested. Prize draws with no answers allow the admin to manually select a winner if preferred.

The competition entry page can be placed anywhere on your website using a simple shortcode.

The front-end style is stripped back, allowing the web developer to customise the way it looks using standard CSS styles. Simply copy the basic styling code in /no-frills-prize-draw/css/style.css, paste in to your theme's css file and make any necessary amendments. All prize draw fields are exported with simple class names to assist in simple css styling.

Many more features are available on the PRO version, including multiple competitions (including start and end dates), additional customisation and much more. Check it out at www.jamestibbles.co.uk/no-frills-prize-draw-pro.
